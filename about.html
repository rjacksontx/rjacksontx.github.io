	<h2>“Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.” - Anonymous</h2>
		<p>From an early age, I loved learning about other countries and cultures and my desire to travel has only grown through the years.  Some trips are short and some trips are long.  Some trips are local and some are international.  Some trips are solo and some are with others.  No two trips are ever the same except for one aspect.  I always return a different person for having traveled and learning along the way.  For those that love to travel, I hope this site gives you inspiration for your next trip.  For those of you who are not able to travel then I want this site to be your trip from which you can learn and experience new and different places. Enjoy your journeys.
